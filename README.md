Utilizing the dataset ‘Fish_InchLake2’ in the FSA data, I have analyzed and drawn out some figures in order to make deeper dive into the 09 distinct fish species data along with year statistics and got some insights based on their weight and tail length relationships.  

Key findings

According to the analysis of fish count per species from 2017 to 2018, we can see the order of 09 distinct species from the highest quantity to the lowest quantity, with Bluegill as the outstanding one and accounting for more than 40% of the total fish amount (as the graph). The figure shows us the distinguishing amount of two years and it indicates that the Largemouth Bass, 	Black Crappie, and Iowa Darter developed mostly in 2018, meanwhile, the majority of Pumpkinseed appeared in 2017. 

Second, the figure below demonstrates important information about the weight and tail length range of fish species. While the Bluegill’s size falls under 10 (tail length) and under 300 lbs (weight), the Largemouth Bass has significantly varied sizes.
